                <p>Isn't it obvious Morty? I froze him. These 2 halves don't belong together, bitch! Puffy vagina. Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of them, Rick!</p>
                <p>Well he roped me into this! This isn't Game of Thrones, Morty. Life is effort and I'll stop when I die! Wow I really crononberg'd up the whole place huh Morty, just a bunch a cronenbergs walkin around.</p>
                <p>I'd like to order one large person with extra people please. white people, no no no black people... and hispanic on half. You're young, you have your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut yet malleable. Aw, c'mon Rick. That doesn't seem so bad. Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.</p>
